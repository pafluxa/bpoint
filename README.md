B-Point is a stand-alone pointing library written in C that uses spherical trigonometry instead of quaternions.

The author of this code is Michael "Mike" K. Brewer. Me (Pedro Fluxa), I am a mere maintainer of this repository and the
code itself so other people can use it in their projects. Thanks Mike!
